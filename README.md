# Um What Day Is It?
Because seriously, what day is it? Live at https://umwhatdayisit.com/

## Background
Built in early 2020, this project was a fun way to answer the question a lot of people had during the repetitiveness of the pandemic.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Gatsby as a React-based static site generator
- Backend: Google Sheets as CMS
- Hosting: Netlify

## New Backend (Aug 2022)
I recently revisited this project and decided to write a new backend using a stack that I didn't have much experience with. I chose to build a REST API with Django, a Python web framework, and MongoDB as the database.
